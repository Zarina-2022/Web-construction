<h3>This site was made using only HTML and CSS.</h3>

<h3> Here, a magnificent visuality has been achieved by </br>

using hover and other features on tags such as button, image, title, paragraf, div.</h3>

<h3> And also, different page arrangements were made. And in addition, </br>

maps and icons from Google were added.</h3>
